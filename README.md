### ðŸ”¹ Skill Demand Analysis

The graph reveals **clear specialization trends** across data roles:

- **Data Analysts** heavily rely on **SQL (47.1%)** and **Excel (34.1%)**, showing that traditional tools are still dominant. Python (29.2%) is gaining ground, indicating a shift toward scripting-based analysis. Visualization tools like **Tableau** and **Power BI** are moderately demanded, suggesting that storytelling with data remains important but secondary.

- **Data Scientists** show a strong preference for **Python (66%)**, followed by **SQL (45.8%)**, making coding and querying essential. The presence of **R (34.6%)** and **SAS (17.1%)** suggests statistical modeling is still relevant in certain segments. Visualization (Tableau) is far less emphasized in this role.

- **Data Engineers** show a blend of **traditional querying (SQL â€“ 60.7%)** and **scripting (Python â€“ 58%)**, but whatâ€™s most unique is the strong presence of **cloud tech**: **AWS (33.3%)**, **Azure (32.6%)**, and **Spark (28.8%)**. This reflects how engineering roles are evolving toward managing large-scale, distributed systems.

### ðŸ§  Key Takeaways:
- **SQL + Python** are core skills across all roles.
- **Excel** is still very relevant â€” especially for Analysts.
- **Cloud tools** are now essential for Engineering roles.
- **Visualization skills** are secondary but useful for communication-heavy roles like Data Analyst.

### ðŸ”¹ Global Job Role Demand â€“ Top 10 Roles

- **Data Analyst** leads the global job market with over **196,000 listings**, followed closely by **Data Engineer** (186k+) and **Data Scientist** (172k+), confirming their dominance in the data ecosystem.
- Non-core data roles such as **Business Analyst** and **Software Engineer** also make it to the top 10, reflecting the crossover of analytical and technical skills across job categories.
- **Senior roles** like *Senior Data Engineer* and *Senior Data Scientist* have substantial visibility, suggesting that companies are equally investing in experienced professionals.
- **Machine Learning Engineers** and **Cloud Engineers**, although critical in advanced analytics and infrastructure, are relatively lower in volumeâ€”possibly due to their niche, specialized requirements.

### ðŸ”¹ Skill Demand vs. Salary for Data Analysts

#### ðŸ“ˆ Top In-Demand Skills
- The most **frequently required** skills for Data Analysts are practical tools like **Excel**, **Word**, **PowerPoint**, and **Power BI**, reflecting the need for day-to-day reporting, presentations, and dashboard creation.
- **SQL**, **Python**, and **Tableau** continue to dominate the technical skill requirements, highlighting their critical role in data handling and visualization.
- While these tools are commonly requested, their **median salaries remain moderate**, around the $90K mark, showing that high demand doesnâ€™t always equate to high pay.

#### ðŸ’° Top Paying Skills
- On the other end, niche technologies such as **Solidity**, **SVN**, **GitLab**, and **Terraform** top the salary chart, offering **$150Kâ€“$190K+ median salaries**.
- Skills like **Datarobot**, **MxNet**, and **Golang**, though **less frequently listed**, are extremely valuable in specialized roles like ML automation, cloud engineering, or blockchain applications.
- These insights suggest that **rare but high-impact skills** can significantly boost earning potential, even if they are not required in most traditional data analyst roles.
